# About Me ðŸ™‚
Hi, I'm Monalisa! Iâ€™m a data enthusiast with a strong passion for analytics and problem-solving. Currently, Iâ€™m diving into SQL, Python, and Power BI, aiming to build a solid foundation in data analytics and visualization. I enjoy exploring how data can drive meaningful insights and support decision-making in various industries.
